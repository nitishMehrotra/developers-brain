# Roadmap

üß† Developers' Brain is an attempt to build the community around mental models
of dev community, their tools and day to day workflows. In this attempt I am
laying out a roadmap of stuff that needs to happen for the community to
flourish. Please take this is as an indication of future scope of the project
and not an exhaustive list.
