# Assign Bugs - Nitish Mehrotra

Being a small team at Kloudi, bugs are all currently assigned to me but they can
be discovered either by any of the team members at Kloudi.
However, critical thing is assignment of these bugs can happen at any of the tools that we use
internally and all of them need to be assigned to the respective owner.
