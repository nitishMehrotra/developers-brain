## Motivation Behind worklfows.collab

Developer community have always been collaborating around Q&As ([Stack
Overflow](www.stackoverflow.com)), stacks ([Stack Share](www.stackshare.io)),
code and configurations ([Github](www.github.com), [Gitlab](www.gitlab.com),
etc) but there has always been a lack of collaboration and community around
mental that folks in the industry deploy for their day to day activities.
