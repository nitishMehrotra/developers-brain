# Inspiration

This project was started as an attempt to start tracking my pesonal mental
models while I was building [Kloudi](https://kloudi.tech/). In an attempt to do
so I got exposed to [Zettelkasten Method](https://zettelkasten.de/posts/overview/) and
[Building a Digital Brain](https://tomcritchlow.com/2019/02/17/building-digital-garden/). I
very quickly realised that, tech community have always been collaborating around Q&As
([StackOverflow](https://www.stackoverflow.com)), Stacks
([Stackshare](https://www.stackshare.io)), code and configurations
([Github](https://www.github.com), etc) but there has always
been a lack of collaboration and community around mental models that people in
the industry deploy for their day to day activities.

With Developers' Brain I am not trying to be another repository of top Vim
configurations or Git settings but as continoue living garden of actual
workflows that a developers uses to achieve an outcome. Hopefully, with the ever
expanding universe of people who code, tools we use and new workflows and design
patterns we deploy this can serve as a place to cultivate the community brain.
