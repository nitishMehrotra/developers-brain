# Inspiration

This project started as my attempt to start tracking my pesonal mental models
and then optimizing as time goes by. I eventually realised that,
tech community have always been collaborating around Q&As ([Stack
Overflow](www.stackoverflow.com)), Stacks ([Stack Share](www.stackshare.io)),
code and configurations ([Github](www.github.com), [Gitlab](www.gitlab.com),
etc) but there has always been a lack of collaboration and community around
mental models that people in the industry deploy for their day to day activities.

With Developers' Brain I am not trying to be another repository of top Vim
configurations or Git settings but as continoue living garden of actual
workflows that a developers uses to achieve an outcome. Hopefully, with the ever
expanding universe of people who code, tools we use and new workflows and design
patterns we deploy this can serve as a place to cultivate the community brain.
