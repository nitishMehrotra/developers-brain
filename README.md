# Developers' Brain üß†

A living collection of all the mental-models from people in the
tech industry (developers, SREs, QAs, EMs, etc) use on a day-to-day basis.
With Developers' Brain the attempt is to build a digital garden of workflows
around People, Tools and their Workflows.

# How to Use A Developers' Brain üß†

- Browse around the [Wiki](wiki/wiki.md) to discover mental models around
  People, Tools or Workflows. Two way through which you can browse Developers'
  Brain:
  - Check out the hosted version of [Developers Brain
    üß†](https://devlopers-brain.vercel.app/) on Vercel
  - By cloning the repo to explore the data offline using
    [Foam](https://foambubble.github.io/foam/) and its
    [Graph-Visualisation](https://foambubble.github.io/foam/graph-visualisation)
    in VSCode.
- Information in each note is meant to give you an explaination and motivate you to explore more.
- Submit your own mental model either through a
  [PR](https://github.com/nitishMehrotra/developer-brain/pulls) or sending
  a DM on twitter (https://twiter.com/@Nitish_Mehrotra)
- Share the workflows with your team and the world.

# Motivation

This project was started as an attempt to start tracking my pesonal mental models
and then optimizing as time passes by. I eventually realised that,
tech community have always been collaborating around Q&As ([Stack
Overflow](www.stackoverflow.com)), Stacks ([Stack Share](www.stackshare.io)),
code and configurations ([Github](www.github.com), etc) but there has always
been a lack of collaboration and community around mental models that people in
the industry deploy for their day to day activities.

With Developers' Brain I am not trying to be another repository of top Vim
configurations or Git settings but as continoue living garden of actual
workflows that a developers uses to achieve an outcome. Hopefully, with the ever
expanding universe of people who code, tools we use and new workflows and design
patterns we deploy this can serve as a place to cultivate the community brain.
