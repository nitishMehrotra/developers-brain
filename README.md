# 🧠 Developers' Brain

A living collection of all the mental-models from people in the
tech industry (developers, SREs, QAs, EMs, etc) use on a day-to-day basis.
With Developers' Brain the attempt is to build a digital garden of workflows
around People, Tools and their Workflows.

# 📜 How to Use It

- Browse around the [wiki](content/wiki/wiki.md) to discover mental models around
  People, Tools or Workflows. Two way through which you can browse Developers'
  Brain:
  - Check out the hosted version of [Developers Brain
    🧠](https://developers-brain.vercel.app/) on Vercel
  - By cloning the repo to explore the data offline using
    [Foam](https://foambubble.github.io/foam/) and its
    [Graph-Visualisation](https://foambubble.github.io/foam/graph-visualisation)
    in VSCode.
- Information in each note is meant to give you an explaination and motivate you to explore more.
- Submit your own mental model either through a
  [PR](https://github.com/nitishMehrotra/developer-brain/pulls) or sending
  a [DM](https://twitter.com/@Nitish_Mehrotra)
  > We are still working on figuring out the best way to add content from the
  > community. Refer to the [🚗 Roadmap](#-roadmap) for more info.
- Share the workflows with your team and the world.

# 💡 Inspiration

This project was started as an attempt to start tracking my pesonal mental
models while I was building [Kloudi](https://kloudi.tech/). In an attempt to do
so I got exposed to [Zettelkasten Method](https://zettelkasten.de/posts/overview/) and
[Building a Digital Brain](https://tomcritchlow.com/2019/02/17/building-digital-garden/). I
very quickly realised that, tech community have always been collaborating around Q&As
([StackOverflow](https://www.stackoverflow.com)), Stacks
([Stackshare](https://www.stackshare.io)), code and configurations
([Github](https://www.github.com), etc) but there has always
been a lack of collaboration and community around mental models that people in
the industry deploy for their day to day activities.

With Developers' Brain I am not trying to be another repository of top Vim
configurations or Git settings but as continoue living garden of actual
workflows that a developers uses to achieve an outcome. Hopefully, with the ever
expanding universe of people who code, tools we use and new workflows and design
patterns we deploy this can serve as a place to cultivate the community brain.

Here are few intresting blogs/talks that also motivated the project.
